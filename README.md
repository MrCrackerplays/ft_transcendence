This project is about connecting both a frontend and backend created from scratch to play Pong on a website, along with several other features.

# Compilation

This project is still currently in development.

To start clone the project and open a terminal to the directory

```
npm install
```

It is important to open Docker before launching the application as this stores our backend database.

Once docker has started and is running you may proceed.

In the top directory
```make dev``` and in a seperate terminal from the top of the directory ```cd frontend/ && npm run dev```

After both projects have finished launching,  the `make dev` terminal will have a lot of green logs and the `npm run dev` terminal will have a link to the localhost.

You may now proceed to link from `npm run dev` terminal and proceed with the frontend, or checking the localhost of the backend through the webpage with the correct endpoints.

(This readme is subject to change closer to release of the project, this is just temporary to have the steps needed in order to launch the project at a minimum)
